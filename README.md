# Green Door
A website that lists thrift shops in Singapore to encourage buying pre-used clothes instead of overconsumption and buying new clothes which has a bad impact on the environment. 

According to UN figures, it takes almost 8000 gallons of water ‚Äì what one person drinks in seven years ‚Äì to make one pair of jeans. And when those jeans are discarded, they join the 21 billion tons of textiles that end up in landfills each year. 

We hope to educate people and provide convenient access to better buying choices to save the earth.
